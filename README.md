## Quickstart
ONLY FOR WINDOWS 
[Download here](https://github.com/blueboy4g/RS_Trainer/blob/main/Output/AzulynSetup.exe), click the three dots in the top right corner of the webpage and select "Download" to download the installer.

If this gets support perhaps Mac/Linux will be added in the future.

You'll want to edit keybinds inside the software once you launch it.

Create or import new boss rotation files that you can use in game either via an overlay or in a standalone application.
