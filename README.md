## Quickstart
ONLY FOR MAC
[Download here](https://github.com/blueboy4g/RS_Trainer/blob/mac_1.0.0/dist/installer/Azulyn%207.0.dmg), click the three dots in the top right corner of the webpage and select "Download" to download the installer.

Mac is very behind the windows editions! It took me 50 hours just to get it working for you guys.  

1. Install via the download icon next to “RAW” in middle/upper right.
2. Open the download and drag into Applications.
3. Now run the application.
4. You probably get promoted to "allow" open now.
5. You also probably get promoted allow Keystrokes from “Terminal” allow that.
6. If you have a new mac you'll get prompted to install Rosetta do that as well.
7. BOOM it should now work?
8. Now to edit key binds OR change your PVM rotation
9. Open finder go to Macintosh HD > Users > “your computer name here”.
10. Hit the three keys “command” + “shift” + “.” to see hidden files you should now see a .config file, open that, open Azulyn. Here is where you will edit key binds and put boss rotations! 
11. The mac_default.json is the boss rotation that will always run. I would save a couple rotations you want and just rename them to mac_default.json when you want it active.
12. Want to uninstall? Delete the app from the Application folder and delete the “Azulyn” folder inside .config
